Mommy's Money allows you to easily mail excess gold from alts to your main character or bank alt, based on a set limit.

 

Simply set a main and a gold limit, and use the command /mm when a mailbox is open.

All excess gold will be sent to the set character!

 

It is recommended to use a /mm macro for easily sending gold and avoiding having to type out the command each time.


Happy Alt'ing!
